## Description

`AvatarImageView` is a customisable subclass of UIImageView that is designed to show users' profile pictures. It falls back to the user's initials with a random background color if no profile picture is supplied.

This library was inspired by and is supposed to be a Swift rewrite of [bachonk/UIImageView-Letters](https://github.com/bachonk/UIImageView-Letters). 

##Usage

To set up `AvatarImageView`, a `dataSource` that conforms to `AvatarImageViewDataSource` needs to be set. Optionally a `configuration` that conforms to `AvatarImageViewConfiguration` can also be set. The default configuration will show a square picture; and if no profile picture is supplied, it will draw the initials with the system font on a random background color.

The `AvatarImageViewDataSource` contains the following members. All have default implementations and are hence optional.

* `var name: String { get }` - Default: returns `""`
* `var avatar: UIImage? { get }` - Default: returns `nil`
* `var bgColor: UIColor? { get }` - Default: returns `nil` 
* `var initials: String { get }` - Default: returns initials calculated from the name.
* `var avatarId: Int { get }` - Default: returns the hash values of the name and initials combined using XOR.

The `AvatarImageViewConfiguration` contains the following members. All have default implementations and are hence optional.

* `var shape: Shape { get }` - Default: returns `.Square`
* `var textSizeFactor: CGFloat { get }` - Default: returns `0.5`
* `var fontName: String? { get }` - Default: returns `nil` 
* `var bgColor: UIColor? { get }` - Default: returns in`nil`. The `bgColor` in `AvatarImageViewDataSource` will take precedence over this one.
* `var textColor: UIColor { get }` - Default: returns `.white`.

Check out the [docs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/AvatarImageView/) for more information.

The random background colour is generated for each unique user from its `avatarId`, so if you have `AvatarImageView`s in different parts of your app, the background color for a particular user will be the same in both.

The image view can be drawn as a square or circle out of the box. You can even sepcify a mask image if you want a custom shape. These settings are done in an `AvatarImageViewConfiguration`. Here are some examples for initials being drawn in different shapes.

Here's an example of when the `dataSource` supplies a profile picture and the `configuration` is set to a circle.

It works great with custom fonts!

...and also with `UITableView`s

####Example Project

Please refer to the example project in this repository for an implementation of all the above use cases. If you find any bugs, open a GitHub issue!

####Gotchas

1. Always set the `configuration` before the `dataSource`. If you don't, you will need to manually call `refresh()` to render the view correctly.

2. When implementing the `AvatarImageViewDataSource` and `AvatarImageViewConfiguration` protocols, you will need to explicitly define the type for any protocol member that is an optional otherwise Swift goes insane.

For example, `AvatarImageViewConfiguration` has a type called `var fontName: String?` that returns `nil` by default. To implement this in a `struct`, define it as follows:

```swift
struct Config: AvatarImageViewConfiguration {
    var fontName: String? = "Futura-Medium"        
}
```
	
Defining it as:

```swift
struct Config: AvatarImageViewConfiguration {
    var fontName = "Futura-Medium"
}
```

... will not work :(

## Documentation

[Docs are available on CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/AvatarImageView/)

## Requirements

AvatarImageView requires at least iOS 8.

## Installation

AvatarImageView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, add the following lines to your Podfile:

    use_frameworks!
    
    # Swift 2.2
    pod "AvatarImageView", '1.1.1'
    
    # Swift 2.3
    pod "AvatarImageView", '1.2.0'
    
    # Swift 3.0
    pod "AvatarImageView", '~> 2.0.0'
    
## Release Notes

####2.0.0
Migrated code to Swift 3.0.

####1.2.0
Migrated code to Swift 2.3.  No further features or patches will be issued for Swift 2.3 after this release.

####1.1.1
Modified `init(frame:)` to be public.

####1.1.0
Improved the random color generator. It now generates a hash from the initials and name, and then uses that as the seed to generate the random color, so it's always the same for each unique user.

####1.0.0
Initial Release
